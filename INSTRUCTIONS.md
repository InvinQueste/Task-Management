## Setup

1. **Download** the entire repo and unzip to `xampp/htdocs/`
2. **Start** Apache and MySQL in XAMPP
3. **Open your browser** and go to:  
   [http://localhost/task-management/](http://localhost/task-management/)

## First Steps

- You’ll be **automatically redirected** to the login page:  
  `localhost/task-management/frontend/auth/login.html`
- **Switch to Register** using the link and create an account
- **Login** with your new account

## Notes

- The project **automatically creates the database** on the first API call to the backend.
- **No manual SQL setup is needed!**
- For testing, a sample SQL file is provided:  
  `backend/db/sample.sql`  
  This creates a tester account with pre-set tasks suited for testing (including expired tasks).
