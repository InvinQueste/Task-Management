# Project 1. Simple Task Management Application:
-	Description: A web application where users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. Features could include setting deadlines, assigning priorities, and marking tasks as complete.
-	PHP Backend: Handle user authentication (login/registration), store task data in a database (like MySQL), and manage tasks with create, read, update, delete operations.
-	JavaScript Frontend: Use JavaScript to dynamically render the task list, handle user interactions (adding, editing, deleting tasks), and make asynchronous requests to the PHP backend (using Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest). You could enhance the UI with basic HTML and CSS.
